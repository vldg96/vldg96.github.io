    <h4>The fire burst the house and let it slam flat down, <br>puffing out skirts of spark and smoke.In the kitchen, an instant before the rain of fire and timber, <br>the stove could be seen making breakfasts at a psychopathic rate, ten dozen eggs, six loaves of toast, <br>twenty dozen bacon strips,which, eaten by fire, started the stove working again, hysterically hissing!<br>The crash. The attic smashing into kitchen and parlor. The parlor into cellar, cellar intosub-cellar. <br>Deep freeze, armchair, film tapes, circuits, beds, and all like skeletons thrown in acluttered mound deep under.<br><br><a href="page 15.html">Smoke and silence. <br>A great quantity of smoke.</a></h4>
