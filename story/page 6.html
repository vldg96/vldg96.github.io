        <h4>Twelve noon.
        <br><br>A dog whined, shivering, on the front porch.The front door recognized the dog <br>voice and opened. The dog, once huge and fleshy, but now gone to bone and <br>covered with sores, moved in and through the house, tracking mud. <br>Behind it whirred angry mice, angry at having to pick up mud, <br>angry at inconvenience. For not a leaf fragment blew under the door but what <br>the wall panels flipped open and thecopper scrap rats flashed swiftly out. <br>The offending dust, hair, or paper, seized in miniature steeljaws, was raced back to <br>the burrows. There, down tubes which fed into the cellar, it was dropped into the <br>sighing vent of an incinerator which sat like evil Baal in a dark corner.<br>The dog ran upstairs, hysterically yelping to each door, at last realizing, <br>as the house realized, that only silence was here.It sniffed the air and scratched the <br>kitchen door. Behind the door, the stove was makingpancakes which filled the <br>house with a rich baked odor and the scent of maple syrup. The dog frothed at the <br>mouth, lying at the door, sniffing, its eyes turned to fire. It ranwildly in circles, <br>biting at its tail, spun in a frenzy, and died.
