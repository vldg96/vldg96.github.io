        <h4>Ten more voices died. In the last instant under the fire avalanche, other choruses,oblivious, could be heard announcing the time, playing music, cutting the lawn by remote-controlmower, or setting an umbrella frantically out and in the slamming and opening front door, athousand things happening, like a clock shop when each clock strikes the hour insanely before orafter the other, a scene of maniac confusion, yet unity; singing, screaming, a few last cleaning mice darting bravely out to carry the horrid ashes away! 
            <br><br><a href="page 14.html">And one voice, with sublime disregard for the situation, read poetry aloud in the fiery study, until all the film spools burned, until all thewires withered and the circuits cracked.</a></h4>
