        <h4>Two o'clock, sang a voice.<br><br>Delicately sensing decay at last, <br>the regiments of mice hummed out as softly <br>as blown grayleaves in an electrical wind.
        <br><br>Two-fifteen.<br><br>The dog was gone.<br>In the cellar, the incinerator glowed suddenly <br>and a whirl of sparks leaped up the chimney.
        <br><br>Two thirty-five.
        <br><br>Bridge tables sprouted from patio walls. <br>Playing cards fluttered onto pads in a shower of pips. <br>Martinis manifested on an oaken bench with <br>egg-salad sandwiches. Music played. <br>But the tables were silent and the cards untouched.
        <br><br><a href="page 8.html">At four o'clock the tables folded like great<br> butterflies back through the paneled walls.</a></h4>
