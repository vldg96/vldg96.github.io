    <h4>In the living room the voice-clock sang,<br>Tick-tock, seven o'clock, time to get up, time to get up, seven o'clock!<br>as if it were afraid nobody would. The morning house lay empty. <br> The clock ticked on, repeating and repeating its sounds into the emptiness. <br>Seven-nine, breakfast time, seven-nine!
    <br> <br>In the kitchen the breakfast stove gave a hissing sigh and ejected<br> from its warm interior eight pieces of perfectly browned toast, <br>eight eggs sunnyside up, sixteen slices of bacon, <br>two coffees, and two cool glasses of milk.
    <br> <br>"Today is August 4, 2026,"<br> <br>said a second voice from the kitchen ceiling, "in the city of Allendale, California." <br>It repeated the date three times for memory's sake. <br>"Today is Mr. Featherstone's birthday. Today is the anniversary of Tilita's marriage. <br>Insurance is payable, as are the water, gas, and light bills."
