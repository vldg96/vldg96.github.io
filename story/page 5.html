        <h4>Ten o'clock. 
        <br><br>The sun came out from behind the rain. <br>The house stood alone in a city of rubble and ashes. <br> This was the one house left standing.<br> At night the ruined city gave off a radioactive glow <br>which could be seen for miles.
        <br><br>Ten-fifteen. 
            <br><br>The garden sprinklers whirled up in golden founts, filling the soft morning air with scatterings of brightness. <br>The water pelted windowpanes, running down the charred westside where the house had been burned evenly free <br>of its white paint. The entire west face of thehouse was black, save for five places. Here the silhouette in paint of a <br>man mowing a lawn. Here,as in a photograph, a woman bent to pick flowers. Still farther over, their images burned <br>on wood in one titanic instant, a small boy, hands flung into the air; higher up, the image of a thrown ball,<br>and opposite him a girl, hands raised to catch a ball which never came down. <br><br>The five spots of paint: the man, the woman, the children, the ball remained. <br>The restwas a thin charcoaled layer.The gentle sprinkler rain filled the garden with falling light. <br>Until this day, how well the house had kept its peace. <br>How carefully it had inquired, "Whogoes there? What's the password?" and, getting no answer from <br>lonely foxes and whining cats, ithad shut up its windows and drawn shades in an old maidenly preoccupation with <br>self-protection which bordered on a mechanical paranoia.It quivered at each sound, the house did. <br>If a sparrow brushed a window, the shadesnapped up. The bird, startled, flew off! No, not even a bird must touch <br>the house!The house was an altar with ten thousand attendants, big, small, servicing, attending, inchoirs.
