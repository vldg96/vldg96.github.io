    <h4>Eight-one, tick-tock, eight-one o'clock, off to school, off to work, run, run, eight-one! <br>But no doors slammed, no carpets took the soft tread of rubber heels. It was raining <br>outside. Theweather box on the front door sang quietly: "Rain, rain, go away; rubbers, <br>raincoats for today..."And the rain tapped on the empty house, echoing. Outside, <br>the garage chimed and lifted its door to reveal the waiting car. After a long wait the <br>door swung down again. At eight-thirty the eggs were shriveled and the toast was like <br>stone. An aluminum wedgescraped them into the sink, where hot water whirled them <br>down a metal throat which digested and flushed them away to the distant sea. <br><br><a href="page 4.html">The dirty dishes were dropped into a hot washer andemerged twinkling dry.</a></h4>
