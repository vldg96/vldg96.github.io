        <h4>Nine-fifteen, sang the clock, time to clean.<br> Out of warrens in the wall, tiny robot mice darted. <br>The rooms were acrawl with the smallcleaning animals, <br>all rubber and metal. They thudded against chairs, <br>whirling their mustached runners, <br>kneading the rug nap, sucking gently at hidden dust. <br>Then, like mysterious invaders, theypopped into their burrows. <br>Their pink electric eyes faded.
