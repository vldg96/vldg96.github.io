<h4>The house tried to save itself. <br>
  <br>
  Doors sprang tightly shut, but the windows were broken by the heat and <br>
  the wind blew and sucked upon the fire. The house gave ground as the fire <br>
  in ten billion angry sparks moved with flaming ease from room to room <br>
  and then up the stairs. While scurrying water rats squeaked from the <br>
  walls, pistoled their water, and ran for more. And the wall sprays let down <br>
  showers of mechanical rain.But too late. Somewhere, sighing, a pump <br>
  shrugged to a stop. The quenching rain ceased. The reserve water supply <br>
  which had filled baths and washed dishes for many quiet days was gone.<br>
  The fire crackled up the stairs. It fed upon Picassos and Matisses in the upper halls, <br>
  like delicacies, baking off the oily flesh, tenderly crisping the canvases into black shavings. <br>
  Now the fire lay in beds, stood in windows, changed the colors of drapes! <br>
  And then, reinforcements. From attic trapdoors, blind robot faces peered down with <br>
  faucet mouths gushing greenchemical.The fire backed off, as even an elephant must at <br>
  the sight of a dead snake. Now there were twenty snakes whipping over the floor, <br>
  killing the fire with a clear cold venom of green froth. But the fire was clever. <br>
  It had sent flames outside the house, up through the attic to the pumps there. <br>
  An explosion! The attic brain which directed the pumps was shattered into bronze shrapnel on the beams.<br>
