        <h4>Five o'clock. The bath filled with clear hot water.
        <br><br>Six, seven, eight o'clock. 
        <br><br>The dinner dishes manipulated like magic tricks, and in the studya click. <br>In the metal stand opposite the hearth where a fire now blazed up warmly, <br>a cigar poppedout, half an inch of soft gray ash on it, smoking, waiting.
        <br><br>Nine o'clock. The beds warmed their hidden circuits, for nights were cool here.
        <br><br>Nine-five. 
        <br><br>A voice spoke from the study ceiling: <br>"Mrs. McClellan, which poem would you like this evening?" <br>The house was silent. <br>The voice said at last, "Since you express no preference, <br>I shall select a poem at random." <br><br>Quiet music rose to back the voice. <br>"Sara Teasdale. As I recall, your favorite..."<h4>
            
        <p>There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,<br>
        And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;<br>
        And frogs in the pools singing at night,<br>
        And wild plum trees in tremulous white;<br>
        Robins will wear their feathery fire,<br>
        Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;<br>
        And not one will know of the war, not one<br>
        Will care at last when it is done.<br>
        Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree, if mankind perished utterly;<br>
        And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn<br>
        Would scarcely know that we were gone.</p>
            
            <h4><a href="page 10.html">The fire burned on the stone hearth and the cigar fell away into a mound of <br>quiet ash on its tray. The empty chairs faced each other between the silent walls, <br>and the music played.</a></h4>
